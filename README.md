# Mutation spectrum similarities as evidence of common descent

## Background
This analysis was made in preparation of a contribution to a book on evolutionary creation (theistic evolution) vs anti-evolutionary creation ("creationism"). A similar analysis was made by  [Steve Schaffner](https://biologos.org/articles/testing-common-ancestry-its-all-about-the-mutations) in 2017 and then replicated by [EvoGrad](https://evograd.wordpress.com/2019/02/20/human-genetics-confirms-mutations-as-the-drivers-of-diversity-and-evolution/) in 2019. I replicate these analyses here and add some additional data sets as well.

When assessing the genetic evidence for or against common descent, genetic similarities or differences can be a useful tool.
